# This is our Git cheat sheet ☆*:.｡.o(≧▽≦)o.｡.:*☆

Git cheat sheet is a collaborative document created by Aline and Gustavo Krajuska as a way to help each other (and why not you too?) on getting better and more proficient using Git.

The main goal with this sheet is to make it as simple and straightforward as possible, so you can quickly run your eyes through it and get the information you're looking for. We are also going to work on a more detailed version of it, to be read when you're just starting with Git and want further explanations, not a refreshment for our weak memories.

Please, have in mind that this is a work-in-progress document and consider collaborating with it if you have a secret handy command you think someone could benefit from.
